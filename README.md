# Tiwi Language Practice



A simple teacher and student language-practice app built with Java in Android Studio.

Teachers record reference pronunciations for sample sentences; students record their own versions and can lister to teacher version to compare.



User story: ‚ÄúAs a student, I want to select a sentence, record my pronunciation, and compare it with the teacher‚Äôs recording, so I can practice and improve Tiwi language pronunciation.‚Äù





### ‚ú® Prototype scope



Roles: Teacher/Student (toggle on home screen)



Dataset: sample sentences from Tiwi Dictionary (assets/sentences.json)



Recordings: in-app audio capture (.m4a) saved to app local storage (Firebase later)



Persistence: a writable JSON mirror (files/sentences\_state.json) stores paths + metadata for recordings





### üß† Hypothesis



Hypothesis: Side-by-side access to teacher audio and a student‚Äôs own recording reduces confusion and speeds up pronunciation learning.



User stories (MVP):



Teacher records a reference for a sentence and saves it.



Student records their version and listen to Teacher version to compare.



Future stories:



Cloud sync via Firebase (Storage + Firestore)



Multiple student takes with waveform/score



Offline packs; export/share



Optional geotag/camera notes for field collection



### üì± Screens



Main Screen: title + role toggle + list of sentences



Sentence detail for Teacher role: record/stop, play Teacher's Recording



Sentence detail for Student role: record/stop, play Teacher's Recording, play Your Recording (role-aware UI)
